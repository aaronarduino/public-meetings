# public-meetings
A service to show all upcoming available public meetings for the City of Wichita.

## This branch is for exploring writing Python scrapers for online PDF and HTML meeting schedules

The .ipynb files are Jupyter notebooks, which are like having a REPL in the browser, which lets you intersperse markup/html, charts, etc with your code.

Github renders Jupyter notebooks, so you can open and view them. This is nice for demonstrating code use.
